We have not made any significant assumptions and stuck as closely to the project guidelines as possible. 
In the navigation bar, we have added 3 links- Home, About and Artists, however as the album and songs pages do not lie in any of these categories, we haven't made
similar visual indicators for present directory for these two categories as we have done for the others (underline effect).

There may be minor rendering issues due to incompability with Linux, mainly fonts.
