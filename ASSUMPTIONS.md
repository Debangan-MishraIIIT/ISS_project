We have configured the project such that the flask server runs on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ and the frontend of the website runs on http://127.0.0.1:5500/.

Other than that, have not made any significant assumptions and stuck as closely to the project guidelines as possible. There may be minor rendering issues due to incompability with Linux, mainly fonts.
